name: "Apple (HIG-inspired)"

colors:

\# All hex values approximate, community-measured. Apple ships ADAPTIVE

\# system colors (systemBlue etc.), not fixed hex. Design to the role names.

primary: "#007AFF" # ~systemBlue (community-measured, not Apple-official)

label: "#000000" # text role; adapts in dark mode

secondary\_label: "#3C3C43"

background: "#FFFFFF" # ~systemBackground; adapts in dark mode

success: "#34C759" # ~systemGreen (approximate)

danger: "#FF3B30" # ~systemRed (approximate)

roles: \[systemBlue, label, secondaryLabel, systemBackground, systemGray..systemGray6\]

typography:

font\_family: "'SF Pro', system-ui, -apple-system, sans-serif"

mono: "'SF Mono', ui-monospace, monospace"

scale: { large\_title: 34, title1: 28, title2: 22, title3: 20, headline: 17, body: 17, callout: 16, subhead: 15, footnote: 13, caption1: 12, caption2: 11 }

note: "Apple reference metrics (iOS, Large size). Dynamic Type rescales these."

layout:

spacing\_convention: 8 # 8pt grid with 4pt subdivisions; convention, not an Apple mandate

min\_tap\_target: 44 # 44x44pt, Apple HIG rule

material:

liquid\_glass: "translucent layer that floats above and gives way to content (2025)"

principles:

\- "Clarity: legible, precise, easy to understand."

\- "Deference: the UI serves the content, never competes with it."

\- "Depth: layers and motion convey hierarchy."

\## Overview

Calm, content-first product UI. Chrome recedes; content leads.

\## Colors

Design to semantic roles (systemBlue, label, systemBackground), not raw hex,

so light/dark and contrast modes come for free.

\## Typography

One system family, weight for hierarchy. 17pt body is the legibility floor.

\## Layout

8pt-multiple spacing (convention), 44pt minimum tap targets.

\## Components

Translucent Liquid Glass surfaces layered over content; SF Symbols icons that

match the type weight.

\## Do's and Don'ts

\- Do: reach for systemBlue as the single primary accent.

\- Do: keep 44pt minimum tap targets.

\- Don't: hardcode a "system color" hex as if Apple published it; it is adaptive.

\- Don't: add a second display font; SF carries the hierarchy.
